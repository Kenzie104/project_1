                <h1> Spicy Rice </h1>
                <p> Spicy Rice is a playful display font featuring bold, rounded letters and quirky shapes that evoke a
                        sense of fun and lightheartedness. With its irregular baseline reminiscent of hand-drawn
                        lettering, it’s perfect for engaging headings, logos, and cheerful designs. Ideal for children’s
                        media and vibrant branding, Spicy Rice adds a lively energy that brightens any project. </p>
